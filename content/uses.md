## Editor and terminal

-   [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) with the vim plugin while working with more extensive applications. My editor history looks something like this:  [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/),  [Coda](https://www.panic.com/coda/), and vim in between. I seem to keep coming back to it.
-   [Alacrity](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is my current terminal of choice and is a relatively recent change. Formerly  [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28macOS%29), and [ITerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2)
-   [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com) with the [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt
-   [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) the terminal multiplexer for tabs and window splits since Alacrity doesnâ€™t support them natively
-   Some of my favourite command-line tools include:
    -   [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) a pretty terminal interface for interacting with git
    -   [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching within files
    -   [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for a prettier `cat`
    -   [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for fuzzy searching anything
    -   [Httpie](https://httpie.org/) as an alternative to `curl`
-   [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font for both my editor and terminal
-   All my files are stored in iCloud. Sensitive files are encrypted using [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)
-   Time Machine backs up my computer
